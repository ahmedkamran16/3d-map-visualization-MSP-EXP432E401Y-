# 3d-map-visualization-MSP-EXP432E401Y-

this is 3d visualization software, which maps an individual's room through LIDAR technology

the components needed for such a feat:
-stepper motor
-time of flight sensor
-IMU
-MSP-EXP432E401Y (a microcontroller by Texas Instrument)
-LED
-Push button
-resistors of minimal as well as bigger values

-just run this code on keil (in the c language) and make sure the proper microcontroller is used

note: push button is an ACTIVE-LOW device
